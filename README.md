This repository contains the complete source code of WritePad Handwriting Recognition Engine (HWRE). It is a self-contained project, which does not require any 3rd party development tools or libraries. **Everything you need is here!** You can build WritePad HWRE for the following platforms:

* Apple MAC OS X 10.10+
* Xcode 8+
* Apple iOS 9+
* Microsoft Windows 7+ (Desktop and Windows Store DLLs; ARM, x64, i86)
* Microsoft Windows Mobile 8+
* Linux (practically any distribution with ISO C/C++ compiler)
* Google Android NDK, SDK 4+ (ARM, MIPS, MIPS64, ARM64, i64, i86)

### Building WritePad Engine

Building the handwriting recognition engine on different platforms

**1. MAC OS**

**Development Environment**: Xcode 8+

Open Xcode; open `MACOSX/WritePadSDK-OSX/WritePadSDK-OSX.xcodeproj` project; build for a desired target. This project will build a static library for MAC OS X.


**2. iOS**

**Development Environment**: Xcode 8+

Open Xcode; open `iOS/WritePadReco/WritePadReco.xcodeproj` project; build for a desired target. This project will build a static library for device or simulator depending on the chosen target.

**3. Android**

**Development Environment**: Android NDK 9+ (optional: Android SDK, Android Studio)

To build run `<ndk-path>/ndk-build` in the `Android/WritePadLib` folder. Android native dynamic (.so) libraries will be built for all supported CPUs.

**4. Linux**

**Development Environment**: Linux with C/C++ compiler 

To build simply run `make` in the `Linux` folder.

**5. Windows (desktop)**

**Development Environment**: Windows 10, Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition or better (older version(s) of Visual Studio can also be used, you may need to create a new solution workspace compatible with older version).

Start Visual Studio and open  `libuniversalreco.sln` in the `/UniversalRecognizer/V300` folder. Select the desired build configuration and platform then choose Build/Build Solution.

**6. Windows Store/Windows Mobile**

**Development Environment**: Windows 10, Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition or better (older version(s) of Visual Studio can also be used, you may need to create a new solution workspace compatible with older version).

Start Visual Studio and open  `WritePadReco.sln` in the `UniversalRecognizer/V300/WindowsStore/WindowsStoreReco` folder. Select the desired build configuration and platform, then choose Build/Build Solution.

### SDK Tools

Additonal information about building and using WritePad SDK tools will be posted here soon.
